<h1 data-number="1" id="free-shear-layers-jets"><span
class="header-section-number">1</span> Free Shear Layers: jets</h1>
<p>Let us begin by looking at the structure of a subsonic jet issuing
from a carefully-designed nozzle into the atmosphere.</p>
<p><img src="./Copy_of_Shear_Layer_Control/01.JPG" /></p>
<p>The potential core is where the velocity is still pretty much the
exit velocity.</p>
<p>In the mixing layer, there is a shear, which results in
“vorticity”.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\xi = 2 \omega = \nabla \times \vec{u}
\]</span></p>
<p>Obviously, the potential core is considered to be a region where
there is no vorticity. In regions where there is shear, there is
vorticity. This can be seen by expanding the cross-product definition
above:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\xi = \Big ( \frac{\partial w}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial v}{\partial
z} \Big ) \vec{i} + \Big ( \frac{\partial u}{\partial z} -
\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} \Big ) \vec{j} + \Big ( \frac{\partial
v}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \vec{k} \Big )
\]</span></p>
<p>where there are gradients of velocity perpendicular to the velocity
direction, there is shear. The mixing layer thickness is approximately
0.2x to 0.25x, where x is the distance downstream of the nozzle
exit.</p>
<p><img src="./Copy_of_Shear_Layer_Control/02.JPG" /></p>
<p>A plot of the velocity component parallel to the axis, along the
axis, would look as follows. In the potential core, the velocity can
chance if the external pressure changes, as for example, for a jet
inside a duct of changing cross-section. Otherwise, there would be no
change inside the potential core. Beyond the potential core, the jet
slows down through mixing and momentum exchange with the outside flow:
the influence of the jet spreads outwards, while the influence of the
outside is felt at the axis.</p>
<p><img src="./Copy_of_Shear_Layer_Control/03.JPG" /></p>
<h2 data-number="1.1"
id="why-does-mixing-between-streams-occur-when-there-is-shear"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Why does mixing between streams
occur when there is shear?</h2>
<p>Due to instabilities of the shear layer, some disturbances will
amplify and form vortical structures, where the shear layer “rolls up”:
the inner portion being composed of fluid moving faster than the outer
portions. These vortical structures merge and form large coherent
structures, which are big enough to go far out into each stream. Thus,
fluid which originated in each stream gets “transported” far out into
the other stream. This is called “convective transport”, to distinguish
it from the much slower process of molecular diffusion across
boundaries. When convective transport occur, large “packets” of fluid,
containing zillions of molecules, get flung far out into each stream
from the other.</p>
<p>Now these large-scale structures achieve transport, but this is not
enough to complete the mixing. Inside the large-scale structures, there
are rolled-up shear layers. These again form smaller vortical
structures, and so on down to much smaller scales. Thus, many levels of
shear layers occur. At the smallest levels, there are tiny vortical
structures, with relatively large contact area between fluid that
originated in the two streams. At these levels, thorough mixing is
occurring: the two fluids are getting to be indistinguishable. Thus, the
transport is achieved through the large-scale coherent structures, but
the mixing actually occurs through the fine-scale structures.</p>
<p>As the Reynolds number increases, the variety of size scales
increases, and probably the smallest scales get smaller, so mixing is
promoted.</p>
<p>The concept of mixing and transport can be applied not only to
chemical composition (“species transport”), but also to mass and
momentum. The thickening of a boundary layer is due to “momentum
transport: think of it as the outer lanes of traffic slowing down
because the inner lanes are slowing down. A fast car from the outer lane
zipping into the inner, slow-moving lane, is”mass transport”.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.2" id="control-of-jets"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Control of Jets</h2>
<p>Velocity components can be written as the sum of the time-averaged
(or mean), the random fluctuation about the mean, and the fluctuation
due to coherent structures (which are not quite random).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
u = \bar{u} + u^{\prime} + \tilde{u}
\]</span></p>
<p>If we are able to control the jet, we should be able to change the
length of the potential core, and the extent of the mixing layer.</p>
<p><img src="./Copy_of_Shear_Layer_Control/04.JPG" /></p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="supersonic-vs.-subsonic-jets"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> Supersonic vs. Subsonic Jets</h1>
<p>Shown below is an underexpanded supersonic jet, coming out of a
convergent-divergent nozzle. As the jet comes out of the exit, it
expands because the outside pressure is less than the nozzle exit
pressure. The flow at the edge turns, sending out Prandtl-Meyer
expansion waves. Beyond this, the “slip line” bordering the jet flow is
a line across which the velocity changes sharply, but the static
pressure is the same. This “slip line” is where the shear layer
develops. At the axis (or plane of symmetry if its a 2-D planar jet),
more P-M expansions go outward as the flow expands further. When these
expansion waves reach the outer boundary, the pressure becomes lower
than the outside, forcing the flow to turn back in so that the pressure
stays unchanged across the slip line. This inward turn and pressure rise
occurs across an oblique shock. This process continues until a normal
shock occurs and the flow becomes completely subsonic, spreads out and
slows down.</p>
<p><img src="./Copy_of_Shear_Layer_Control/05.JPG" /></p>
<p>Supersonic jets contain shocks and expansions. We all know that in
supersonic flow, information cannot propagate upstream, so what you do
downstream cannot affect what happens upstream. But note that the mixing
layer contains subsonic flow. So here, information can go back upstream!
This causes phenomena which can be explained using “feedback”. It also
opens up opportunities for controlling such jets. Now lets look closely
at the shear layer.</p>
<p><img src="./Copy_of_Shear_Layer_Control/06.JPG" /></p>
<h2 data-number="2.1" id="instability-wave"><span
class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Instability Wave</h2>
<p>A disturbance which amplifies in a shear layer can be described as an
instability wave. If you monitor velocity fluctuations at a few fixed
points in space, what you see will be a change in velocity which moves
downstream. This similar to having 3 police cars stationed at different
point along the Interstate: each feels a pressure wave and a gust of
wind as something red flashes by, the ones further down the road feel
this a few seconds after the ones stationed up the road. On the other
hand, if you change your coordinates to a system which moves at the
speed of the convecting structures, you will see what appears to be a
vortex: something going round and round. Thus, the police car which
moves at the speed of the red flash sees a Corvette, whose shape remains
constant in time. In the case of fluid structures, note that the
structures move at a speed different from that of the fluid itself: thus
its never the same fluid molecules that are spinning around inside the
coherent structure. Instead, fluid goes in and out of the structure
continuously. This is very important to remember when one looks at, for
example, smoke flow visualization of vortices: the smoke moves at a
speed different from that of the vortex. Now you see why we refer to
these structures as “waves”: they are disturbances propagating like
waves through the fluid. We can associate a “wavelength”, “wavenumber”
“frequency” etc. with these structures.</p>
<p>These structures are also referred to as “Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability”. Consider what happens when the jet is axisymmetric: these
structures would extend all round the jet. So they can be considered to
be like: “Vortex Rings”, similar to what we see when someone is trying
to impress everyone by blowing smoke rings. Smoke rings are vortical
structures developing in the shear layer of a suddenly-accelerated jet
flow, and they remain somewhat stable because the jet continues to
accelerate upwards due to buoyancy, so there is continuous shear.</p>
<p>Wave number: Tell us about changes with distance.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[

<p>Wavelength changes due to vortex pairing, among other things.</p>
<p><img src="./Copy_of_Shear_Layer_Control/07.JPG" /></p>
<h1 data-number="3" id="frequency-domain-concepts"><span
class="header-section-number">3</span> Frequency-domain concepts</h1>
<p>Many things which look hopelessly complicated in the time domain can
be expressed with beautiful simplicity in the frequency domain. To see
this, consider the problem of describing something which goes up and
down, in a sinusoidal fashion, several times a second. Once we recognize
that it does repeat itself periodically, it becomes simple to describe
it. We describe it by one frequency, the amplitude, and maybe a phase
reference. These are fixed.</p>
<p>Extending this, we can try to describe complicated-looking variations
as sums of several simple periodic functions, with different amplitudes.
We can describe these as a series of terms, involving sine and cosine
functions of a fundamental frequency and its multiples. This is the
concept of a Fourier Series. A few assumptions are implicit here. One is
that “linear superposition is valid”.</p>
<p>We will see that operations involving “convolution integrals” can be
reduced to simple multiplication (of complex numbers) in the frequency
domain. There are several such concepts, which help us visualize
relations between variables.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.1" id="spectrum-plural-spectra"><span
class="header-section-number">3.1</span> “Spectrum” (plural:
spectra)</h2>
<p>Refers to the distribution of the energy of fluctuations as a
function of frequency.</p>
<h3 data-number="3.1.1" id="example-autospectrum-of-velocity"><span
class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> Example: Autospectrum of
velocity</h3>
<p>The autospectrum is really the “auto-spectral density function,
integrated over finite intervals of frequency”. Its units are
“velocity-squared per interval of frequency”. In other words, it is a
measure of fluctuation energy (per unit mass) of the property which is
being described: the velocity. The word “auto” refers to the fact that
it is a spectral density function obtained as the product of the
property with itself, i.e,, velocity times velocity. In contrast, there
can be “cross-spectral density functions”, for example, the product of
velocity with pressure, or pressure with density, etc.</p>
<p>Consider a velocity measurement at a point, as a function of
time.</p>
<p>This variation can be supposed to be built up of various sine and
cosine waves, of different frequencies and amplitudes. This is the idea
of a Fourier Series. Conversely, we can “sample” this variation for some
time, and then break it up into the various frequencies, and compute the
amplitudes at each frequency. This is done by taking the “Fourier
Transform” of the sample of the signal. If we do this a number of times,
and average the result, it will probably all cancel out, because we have
no control about the phase of the sines and cosine waves as we begin
each sample. That is, some samples will have velocity going up while
other will have velocity going down, at the same parts of the sample.
Instead, however, if we square the fluctuation, we can avoid this
problem. We can find the average “energy” (i.e., something proportional
to the square of the amplitude) in each frequency interval. This is the
process of constructing a spectrum. Below we see how these “spectra” are
used to discover the various interesting features buried in what looks
like a random fluctuating flow.</p>
<h3 data-number="3.1.2"
id="example-of-a-periodic-or-narrow-band-fluctuation-occurring-in-a-turbulent-flow"><span
class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> Example of a Periodic or
Narrow-Band fluctuation occurring in a turbulent flow</h3>
<p>The spectrum shows a sharp peak in a narrow band of frequencies: this
means that there is something varying almost like a sine wave (nearly
constant frequency).</p>
<p><img src="./Copy_of_Shear_Layer_Control/08.JPG" /></p>
<p>Below, we see a spectrum where there are several frequencies of
instability waves seen: the fundamental and several harmonics.</p>
<p><img src="./Copy_of_Shear_Layer_Control/09.JPG" /></p>
<p>Below is the broad-band spectrum of turbulent flow: there is energy
at every frequency, because there just so many different kinds of
fluctuations occurring.</p>
<p><img src="./Copy_of_Shear_Layer_Control/10.JPG" /></p>
<h1 data-number="4" id="spatial-instability"><span
class="header-section-number">4</span> Spatial Instability</h1>
<p>A spatial instability is a disturbance which grows as it goes
downstream. Below is shown a jet, in which instabilities grow as they go
downstream, eventually resulting in total turbulence. If you place a
hot-film probe in the shear layer just outside the potential core, you
might see the narrow-band peaks of the instability waves, superposed on
the turbulent spectrum. If your sensor is shifted downstream, you will
see that the frequency of this instability wave has decreased, while the
amplitude has increased. Out in the fully-turbulent zone, it will be
hard to distinguish any spectral peak on top of the broad-band
turbulence.</p>
<h1 data-number="5" id="excitation-of-coherent-structures"><span
class="header-section-number">5</span> Excitation of coherent
structures</h1>
<p>Control or excitation of a shear layer can be described using the
frequency, amplitude and “receptivity”. Receptivity refers to how a flow
“receives” the excitation. This concept applies to flows over airfoils
(wall-bounded shear layers) as well as flows coming out of jet nozzles
(free shear layers). The figures below show speakers blasting out sound
at carefully selected frequencies, right close to the points of maximum
receptivity. In the case of the jet exit, the receptivity is maximum in
the immediate vicinity of the exit edge. In the case of an airfoil, its
harder to decide such a point: if the flow is at the point of separating
from the surface and forming a free shear layer, then receptivity would
be maximum at the beginning of the shear layer.</p>
<p><img src=".Copy_of_Shear_Layer_Control/11.JPG" /></p>
<p>Receptivity is usually highest at the jet exit plane edge. Excitation
frequency for a jet is a function of the size of the shear layer, which
is proportional to the jet diameter. Strouhal number <span
class="math inline">\(fD/U\)</span> is around <span
class="math inline">\(0.3\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span> for jets, and <span
class="math inline">\(0.42\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(0.48\)</span> for laminar jets.</p>
<h1 data-number="6" id="screech-tones-in-supersonic-jets"><span
class="header-section-number">6</span> Screech Tones in Supersonic
Jets</h1>
<p>“Screech”, as the word implies, is a loud, high-pitched whistling
sound from underexpanded jets. It is accompanied by severe pressure
fluctuations, which can cause structural fatigue on aircraft components,
not to mention ear drums and nerves of neighbors. In the past, it has
been found that the afterburner duct of jet engines also resonated
sometimes with the screech tone, and this would result in rapid
destruction of the engine. Engine manufacturers have reported in the
early 1980s that of every 20 or so engines built, 1 or 2 would exhibit
this phenomenon: explanations were not easily obvious. A curious aspect
of the screech instability, inside afterburner ducts, was that it
greatly increased the heat release rate inside the afterburner: somehow
the fuel was burning much more quickly and efficiently. So, while the
engine was unable to withstand this high rate of heat transfer, it
appeared that some good might be derived from such oscillations, in the
long run.</p>
<p>Schematic sketches of the occurence of screech and its suppression.
Above, the mechanism of screech is shown: instability waves in the shear
layer interact with shocks, sending pressure pulses which are able to
reach upstream through the shear layer and other subsonic regions. The
pressure wave reaching the nozzle lip triggers new instability waves,
amplifying the phenomenon. Below, the introduction of a baffle around
the jet inhibits upstream propagation of the pressure wave, de-coupling
the lip region from the shock interaction region. <img
src="./Copy_of_Shear_Layer_Control/13.JPG" /></p>
<p>Here we are interested in how the screech occurs in the jet outside
the nozzle exit, and how it can be cured. Note that the jet is
supersonic: no information can propagate upstream, so how can there be
any feedback? The answer is that the flow is not supersonic everywhere
in the shear layer, or outside the jet. As we saw in the Cavity Flow
case, there is a forward propagation path, and a feedback path, and
these are in different portions of the flow. The forward propagation of
disturbances is through the generation of vortical structures (amplified
instability waves) in the shear layer. These move at (you can guess!),
about 0.65 times the jet flow velocity. When the vortical structure hits
a shock, there is a large pressure disturbance. It is debatable whether
this is due to fluctuation of the shock, or distortion of the vortical
structure, or both. At any rate, the pressure disturbances propagate as
sound waves. They can move upstream through the subsonic part of the
shear layer, and through the outside flow (assuming that the outside
flow is not supersonic too). When these pressure fluctuations reach the
nozzle lip (edge of the nozzle exit), they “excite” the shear layer, and
trigger the rollup of new structures, which sail off downstream again.
This completes the loop.</p>
<p>Strouhal numbers for screech tones, based on jet exit diameter and
exit velocity, are approximately, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 etc. Example: If a jet
exit diameter is 0.6 meters, and the exit velocity is 1000 m/s, the
expected frequencies are, approximately, 417, 834, 1668 Hz, etc. We
cannot predict beforehand which of these is going to be most
amplified.</p>
<p>Given that the shear layer is the route for feedback, we can see how
these fluctuations might even creep upstream through the boundary layer,
or the engine liner, into the duct region, and resonate with resonant
modes in the afterburner duct. In practice, the reverse process may be
more likely. Resonant modes of the afterburner duct may be excited, and
send out fluctuations in mass flow and velocity field structure, through
the nozzle exit: these may then lock into one of the preferred modes of
the shear layer /shock interaction loop. At first sight, there is a
choked nozzle between the afterburner duct and the exhaust jet, so no
fluctuations are supposed to escape. But remember that (a) fluctuations
can indeed pass through if the temperature upstream fluctuates, since
the choked mass flow rate is a function of upstream total temperature
and the total pressure, and (b) the boundary layer is subsonic, even in
a choked nozzle.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.1" id="screech-suppression"><span
class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Screech Suppression</h2>
<p>Some surprisingly simple techniques work. One is to put a baffle
around the periphery of the jet. This inhibits the feedback path of the
sound, and thus breaks the resonance loop. For round jets, it is
possible to break the symmetry of the vortex rings by placing a probe or
other asymmetric disturbance at the edge of the shear layer. For
example, in our lab experiment, we found that a pencil introduced into
the shear layer would stop the screech tone. Of course this might have
been because the jet was at a relatively low Reynolds number, and the
turbulence level is very low, so that we had a high level of clean
symmetry. This may not be the case in a jet engine exhaust. On the other
hand, Dr. Ahuja’s team at GTRI has shown that placing small tabs into
the shear layer at the nozzle exit can reduce screech tones greatly.</p>
<p>This goes back to the issue of “receptivity”: even small disturbances
can cause major changes to the instability waves, if introduced at the
region of highest receptivity: the nozzle lip.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.2"
id="convection-speed-of-instability-waves-or-large-eddies"><span
class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Convection Speed of Instability
Waves or Large Eddies</h2>
<p>Considering that the convective speed is about 0.65 times the jet
exit velocity, the convective Mach number can be greater than 1. That
is, the vortical structures zip by, at the edge of the shear layer, like
little supersonic aircraft, and hence must generate their own “sonic
booms”, or propagating shock waves. These make the supersonic jet very
noisy indeed. The noise can be reduced greatly if the convective Mach
number is brought below 1.0.</p>
